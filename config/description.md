The [Seattle Flu Study](https://seattleflu.org/) aims to improve how infectious disease outbreaks are detected, monitored and controlled. The Seattle Flu Study combines enhanced clinical surveillance (at hospitals, clinics, daycares, ports-of-entry, homeless shelters, workplaces, etc.) and novel direct-to-public outreach programs, to heavily sample influenza-like illness (ILI) cases in the Seattle metropolitan area. These specimens are analyzed in a uniform pipeline for molecular diagnostics, genome sequencing and assembly. Molecular diagnostics are used to assess positivity across a panel of 26 respiratory pathogens and influenza-positive samples are subjected to full genome sequencing.

This phylodynamic analysis shows Seattle Flu Study viruses in context with global influenza viruses collected by the [GISRS Network](http://www.who.int/influenza/gisrs_laboratory/en/) and the shared through the [GISAID Initiative](https://gisaid.org).
